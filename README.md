# 🍔 Food Delivery App (Full-Stack MERN Project)

Food Delivery App is a complete full-stack MERN application designed to simulate a real-world online food ordering platform. The application provides a seamless experience for users to explore food items, add them to a cart, place orders, and complete payments securely using Stripe.

The project is structured into three main parts: a user-facing frontend, an admin dashboard, and a backend REST API. The frontend is built with React.js to ensure a responsive and dynamic user interface, while the admin panel allows authorized users to manage food items, monitor orders, and control application data efficiently.

The backend is developed using Node.js and Express.js, following RESTful architecture principles. MongoDB Atlas is used as the cloud database for secure and scalable data storage, and Mongoose is used for schema modeling and database interaction. Payment processing is handled securely through Stripe, ensuring safe and reliable transactions.

The entire project is deployed on Render, making it production-ready and accessible online. This project showcases skills in full-stack development, API design, authentication, database management, payment gateway integration, and cloud deployment, reflecting industry-standard development practices.
